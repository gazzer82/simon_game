#Simon Game for FreeCodeCamp

So this is my first proper attempt at creating a static page, served via Node.JS.

To make things more interesting i am going to do this using vanilla JS (no JQuery), and no other frameworks such as Bootstrap.

I will however be writing the CSS using SCSS and the HTML using Jade, and getting GULP to auto compile those for me, which is a first.

Lets see how it goes.
